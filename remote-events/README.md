Bring your own System or install an ABAP Trial System.
Here is a description how to install an ABAP Trial System: [link](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html)

## ABAP Development Tools

We will use ABAP Development Tools (aka ABAP in Eclipse) for the Pair-Programming Sessions.

## Zoom

When we all have to talk together, we will use [Zoom] (https://zoom.us/). To join the call, you will have to install the software, but it is not necessary to have an account.

### How to interact in Zoom? -> Camera Always On and be polite ;-)

The Short answer is **Camera Always On** and take **care of each others**. Let others formulate what they have in mind and listen to them don´t interrupt your Teammates.

## Cuckoo

It is a web app to measure the time of the iterations and intervals between them.

At the beginning of each iteration we will start a 45-minute pomodoro and at the end a notification is issued in the browser.
No need to install anything, just open this website, to see the time left until the next iteration:

For the retro periods after each session, a timer of 15 will be set.

## Slack

# What will we do during the Remote Coderetreat?

## Iterations

We will make several iterations of ** 45 minutes **, changing partners after each iteration. At the end of the iteration we will do a mini retrospective to share ideas and progress.

## Creating pairs

To keep track of the pairs created in each iteration we will share a Google Sheet

The document has 4 sheets, one per iteration. In each iteration we will identify the people who will lead and their partners using the Slack user ID of both. 

It is the responsibility of the person directing to register their user.

For defining who your partner will be during the iteration, we will use Slack to coordinate.

# How will we coordinate during the event?

During the event we will use Slack to launch warnings and coordinate when changing partners in each iteration.

We will have a video call using Zoom. The Zoom video call will always be open for anyone to join at any time and will be shared via Slack.

# What problem are we going to tackle?

It is customary in Coderetreats that usually the chosen kata is the [Conway's Game of Life] (https://www.coderetreat.org/pages/facilitating/gol/). We changed a little bit this convention and we choose different Code-Kata´s to make the events more incalculable

# Code of conduct

All attendees, speakers and
volunteers of our event accept the following code
conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the
event. We look forward to the collaboration of all the participants to help
ensure a safe environment for all.

## The Quick Version

Our event is dedicated to offering an abuse-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, size, race or religion. We do not tolerate
abuse of event participants in any form. The
sexual language and images are not appropriate for any room in the
event, including talks, workshops, Twitter and other media
on-line. Event participants who violate these rules may
be sanctioned or expelled from it at the discretion of the organizers.

## The Shortest Version

Abuses include: offensive comments regarding gender, orientation
sexual, disability, physical appearance, size, race, religion, images
sexual in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, harassment,
persecution, photography or recording of abuse, continued interruptions
from talks or other events and unwanted sexual attention.

Participants urged to stop any behavior are expected
abusive obey immediately.

If a participant engages in abusive behavior, the organizers
of the event they can take any action they deem appropriate,
including warnings to the offender or their expulsion from the event

If you are being abused, you notice abuse on another person, or
you have any other concern, please contact a member of the
event staff immediately. The event staff
can be easily identified, both through GitHub members
like in slack.

Event staff will be happy to assist participants
to contact local authorities, otherwise assist those

We value your attendance.
